The report investigated sales data between December 2015 to March 2019 from a boutique seller on Poshmark. The goal of the analysis is to find any underlying trends in monthly sales (e.g. seasonal sales). Additionally, it would be in the best interest to find models that give the client an idea of what to expect in the future sales. These models are constructed using the Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) method and the Thin-plate Smoothing (TPS) Spline method.
